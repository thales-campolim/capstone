## Advanced Data Analyst Certificate Project

This project forms a crucial component of the Advanced Data Analyst Certificate program.

The objective is to utilize a machine learning model on a Human Resources dataset sourced from Kaggle. The aim is to assess the likelihood of an employee leaving a company.

In this project, I meticulously cleaned and prepared the dataset for modeling. Following this, I conducted thorough correlation analyses, leading me to select a logistic regression model as the approach to tackle the problem at hand.

While the model demonstrated a commendable ability to predict instances where an employee would stay with the company, it exhibited limitations in accurately predicting cases where an employee would leave.
