# This was a project developed as a capstone of the Google advanced data analyst certificate.

As the course is composed not only by tecniches to analyse data, but also machine learning models, at the end, the challenge is to look at a HR dataset and get some insights from it.

The main question is to predict the chance of a employee leave based on the data available.

Here I first analysed the context, selected variables, and choose to use a logisct regression approach to predict and outcome.

The model didn't show itself very consistent in predicting the main question which was if the employee would leave, however, it showed a decent prediction if the employee would not leave.
